# MIGRATION_NOTES — zudo-doc rebuild (Sub #48)

Snapshot of the fresh `create-zudo-doc` scaffold generated for epic #47
(zudolab/zudo-css-wisdom). This file lives at `__inbox/new-scaffold/` and is
only a staging artefact — the sub-issues under #47 migrate zcss content into
it and then the whole scaffold is swapped into the repo root in Sub #59.

## How this scaffold was produced

```sh
cd __inbox
node /Users/takazudo/repos/myoss/zudo-doc/packages/create-zudo-doc/dist/index.js \
  --preset ./zcss-preset.json \
  --name new-scaffold \
  --no-install
```

The positional `projectName` in the preset is `"zudo-css-wisdom"`; `--name
new-scaffold` overrides it so the output folder lands at
`__inbox/new-scaffold/` instead of a nested `__inbox/zudo-css-wisdom/`. The
scaffolder consumed the preset, filled in any omitted options with its
non-interactive defaults, and composed the templates described below.

`pnpm install --ignore-workspace --prefer-offline` was then run inside
`__inbox/new-scaffold/` to produce `pnpm-lock.yaml` and verify the scaffold
is self-consistent. `--ignore-workspace` was a safety belt — this repo has
no `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, so there was no workspace to stumble over.

## Applied preset features

From `__inbox/zcss-preset.json`:

```
search, sidebarFilter, i18n, claudeResources, claudeSkills,
sidebarResizer, sidebarToggle, docHistory, llmsTxt, skillSymlinker,
tauri, footerNavGroup, footerCopyright
```

Color scheme: `light-dark` with `Default Light` / `Default Dark`, defaulting
to dark and respecting the OS `prefers-color-scheme`. Package manager:
`pnpm`. `cjkFriendly: true` in the preset (see Concerns).

## Scaffold templates used

Base layer:

- `templates/base/` — shared framework: `astro.config.ts` shell,
  `src/content.config.ts`, `src/pages/`, `src/layouts/`, `src/components/`,
  `src/integrations/`, `src/plugins/`, `src/config/`, `src/styles/`,
  `src/utils/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/types/`, `tsconfig.json`, `scripts/`,
  scaffold `CLAUDE.md`, scaffold-level `.gitignore`.

Per-feature layers (`templates/features/<feature>/`) composed on top of
base for every preset feature that has a template dir:

- `templates/features/search/`
- `templates/features/i18n/`
- `templates/features/claudeResources/`
- `templates/features/sidebarResizer/`
- `templates/features/sidebarToggle/`
- `templates/features/docHistory/`
- `templates/features/llmsTxt/`
- `templates/features/tauri/` — produces `src-tauri/` (Cargo.toml, main.rs,
  tauri.conf.json, capabilities, build.rs)
- `templates/features/footer/` — pseudo-feature triggered by
  `footerNavGroup` and `footerCopyright`

Features handled without a separate template dir (per
`create-zudo-doc/src/features/index.ts`):

- **sidebarFilter** — baked into `src/components/sidebar-tree.tsx`, stays in
  base.
- **claudeSkills** — `scaffold.ts` copies `zudo-doc-*` skills
  (design-system, translate, version-bump) from the zudo-doc monorepo into
  `.claude/skills/`.
- **skillSymlinker** — `scaffold.ts` produces `scripts/setup-doc-skill.sh`
  and wires the matching `setup:doc-skill` package.json script.

## Version delta table

"Before" = `/Users/takazudo/repos/wisdom/zudo-css-wisdom/package.json` on
`base/zudo-doc-rebuild` (the pre-rebuild zcss). "After" =
`__inbox/new-scaffold/package.json` as produced by the scaffolder.

| Dep | Before (zcss) | After (scaffold) | Change | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| astro | ^6.0.4 | ^5.18.0 | **MAJOR DOWN** | Scaffold ships the zudo-doc-blessed Astro 5 line. Re-upgrade to 6 is a separate concern — today's `patches/astro@6.0.4.patch` will need replanning. |
| @astrojs/mdx | ^5.0.0 | ^4.3.0 | **MAJOR DOWN** | Paired with Astro 5. |
| @astrojs/react | ^5.0.0 | — | **REMOVED** | Scaffold switches the islands runtime to Preact. |
| @astrojs/preact | — | ^4.1.0 | **NEW** | With `compat: true`, so React-shaped code can keep its `react`/`react-dom` import specifiers via the alias. |
| react | ^19.2.4 | — | **REMOVED** | Preact compat replaces runtime React. |
| react-dom | ^19.2.4 | — | **REMOVED** | Ditto. |
| preact | — | ^10.26.0 | **NEW** | Runtime for islands. |
| @tailwindcss/vite | ^4.2.1 | ^4.2.0 | patch float | Same major. |
| tailwindcss | ^4.2.1 | ^4.2.0 | patch float | Same major. |
| @shikijs/transformers | ^4.0.1 | ^4.0.0 | patch float | Same major. |
| shiki | ^4.0.2 | — | **REMOVED** | Scaffold relies on Astro-bundled Shiki; direct import is gone. Any custom `import { ... } from "shiki"` in migrated code must switch to Astro's re-export or re-add shiki explicitly. |
| remark-directive | ^4.0.0 | ^3.0.0 | **MAJOR DOWN** | Scaffold pins v3. Our admonition pipeline must verify compatibility when sub-issues port remark plugins. |
| unist-util-visit | ^5.1.0 | ^5.1.0 | none | |
| clsx | ^2.1.1 | ^2.1.0 | patch float | |
| diff | ^8.0.3 | ^8.0.3 | none | (Scaffold keeps v8 for the DocHistory diff view.) |
| github-slugger | ^2.0.0 | ^2.0.0 | none | |
| gray-matter | ^4.0.3 | ^4.0.0 | patch float | |
| minisearch | ^7.2.0 | ^7.2.0 | none | |
| remark-cjk-friendly | — | ^2.0.1 | **NEW** | Declared by the scaffold because the preset has `cjkFriendly: true` — but see the Concerns section. |
| @astrojs/check | ^0.9.7 | ^0.9.0 | patch float | |
| @types/hast | ^3.0.4 | ^3.0.4 | none | |
| @types/mdast | ^4.0.4 | ^4.0.4 | none | |
| @types/node | ^25.3.5 | ^22.0.0 | **MAJOR DOWN** | Scaffold pins Node 22 types. Our CI / engines > 20 remains compatible. |
| @types/react | ^19.2.14 | ^19.2.0 | patch float | Scaffold keeps React types for Preact `compat` typings. |
| @types/react-dom | ^19.2.3 | — | **REMOVED** | No standalone react-dom types needed with Preact. |
| typescript | ^5.9.3 | ^5.9.0 | patch float | |
| pagefind | — | ^1.4.0 | **NEW** | Scaffold wires Pagefind as the search backend. |
| lefthook | ^1.11.13 | — | **REMOVED** | Sub-issues port back via scripts. |
| prettier | ^3.5.3 | — | **REMOVED** | Ditto. |
| prettier-plugin-astro | ^0.14.1 | — | **REMOVED** | Ditto. |
| vitest | ^3.2.1 | — | **REMOVED** | Ditto. |

### Astro patch

Current `package.json` has:

```
"pnpm": {
  "patchedDependencies": {
    "astro@6.0.4": "patches/astro@6.0.4.patch"
  }
}
```

The scaffold is on Astro 5, so the existing patch file cannot apply as-is.
Downstream sub-issues must decide whether the patch is still needed, and if
so re-issue against whichever Astro version the rebuilt repo lands on.

## URL-shape override — **deferred to Sub #49**

The preset's `defaultLang: "ja"` caused the scaffold to treat Japanese as
the default locale. In the generated `src/config/settings.ts`:

```
docsDir: "src/content/docs",                               // -> ja
locales: { en: { label: "EN", dir: "src/content/docs-en" } },
```

And in `astro.config.ts` the i18n block hard-codes `defaultLocale: "ja"`
and builds the locale list from `["ja", ...Object.keys(settings.locales)]`.

Epic #47 overrides this to preserve the live zcss URL shape (EN at
`/docs/…`, JA at `/ja/docs/…`). **Sub #48 intentionally does NOT edit the
scaffold to fix this** — the scaffolder rule forbids hand-patching output
that the scaffolder should generate. Sub #49 will flip `docsDir`, `locales`,
and the `astro.config.ts` i18n block, and content files will be moved from
the scaffold's `src/content/docs-en/` into `src/content/docs/` plus
`src/content/docs/` starter into `src/content/docs-ja/`.

## Concerns for downstream sub-issues

1. **`cjkFriendly` mismatch**. The preset sets `cjkFriendly: true` and the
   scaffold installs `remark-cjk-friendly`, but the generated
   `src/config/settings.ts` hard-codes `cjkFriendly: false`. The
   `astro.config.ts` gates `remarkCjkFriendly` behind that flag, so the
   plugin is loaded at the npm level but not registered at runtime. Sub #49
   can flip `settings.cjkFriendly` to `true` while porting settings — this
   does **not** need a scaffolder hand-edit here. Worth reporting upstream
   to `zudo-doc` as a preset-to-settings bug.
2. **React vs Preact**. Today's zcss has hand-written React components
   (notably `<CssPreview>` and `<TailwindPreview>`). The scaffold uses
   Preact with `compat: true`, so most React code should transpile
   unchanged, but anything depending on React-specific runtime internals
   (concurrent features, `react-dom/client`, React devtools hooks) needs
   sub-issue attention. Owner: Sub #53 (port custom components).
3. **Astro downgrade**. The re-scaffold effectively downgrades Astro from
   6.0.4 to 5.18.x. This is the zudo-doc-blessed line today. If the team
   prefers to stay on Astro 6, the right path is to bump `zudo-doc` itself
   and re-scaffold, not to hand-edit the output here.
4. **Custom patches**. `patches/astro@6.0.4.patch` will not apply on Astro
   5.18. Sub #57 (misc files) should carry the decision forward — either
   drop the patch, re-target it at 5.18, or defer until the Astro re-bump.
5. **Node types downgrade**. `@types/node` 22 vs 25. Engines remains
   `>=20`, so no runtime break, but TS type surfaces change slightly (e.g.
   `Stream.Duplex` symbol names). Sub-issues that touch Node APIs should
   re-run `pnpm check` after porting.

## Build verification

**Not** run in Sub #48 by design — `/x-wt-teams` rules ban heavy test /
build work in child agents. `pnpm install` succeeded and produced a clean
lockfile, which is enough here. Full `pnpm build` in `__inbox/new-scaffold/`
is the acceptance criterion for Sub #58 (manager-side verification).
